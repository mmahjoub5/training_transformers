{"id":1,"question":"Why is the sky blue?","answer":"The sky looks blue because sunlight is made of many colors, and blue light spreads out more than the others when it hits the air. When you look up, you see more of that scattered blue light, so the sky looks blue."}
{"id":2,"question":"Why does ice float on water?","answer":"When water freezes, it spreads out and becomes less dense than liquid water. Because it is lighter for its size, ice floats on top instead of sinking."}
{"id":3,"question":"How do vaccines work?","answer":"Vaccines teach your body how to fight germs by showing it a safe version of them. This helps your immune system remember the germ so it can protect you if you get sick later."}
{"id":4,"question":"Why is a PN junction formed when p-type and n-type semiconductors are brought together?","answer":"When p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined, electrons from the n-type region diffuse into the p-type region and recombine with holes, while holes diffuse into the n-type region. This diffusion leaves behind fixed ionized donors and acceptors, creating a depletion region and an internal electric field that opposes further diffusion."}
{"id":5,"question":"Why does a PN junction conduct current under forward bias?","answer":"Under forward bias, the applied voltage reduces the built-in potential barrier of the PN junction. This reduction allows majority carriers to cross the depletion region more easily, resulting in a large diffusion current and significant conduction."}
{"id":6,"question":"Why does the drain current of a MOSFET depend on gate-to-source voltage?","answer":"The gate-to-source voltage controls the electric field across the gate oxide, which determines the amount of charge induced in the channel. As the gate voltage increases beyond the threshold voltage, a conducting channel forms, and the drain current increases with the channel charge density."}
{"id":7,"question":"Why does a circuit’s bandwidth decrease when its load capacitance increases?","answer":"The load capacitance forms an RC network with the circuit’s output resistance. As the capacitance increases, the RC time constant increases, which lowers the pole frequency and therefore reduces the bandwidth."}
{"id":8,"question":"Why is the rise time of a signal related to circuit bandwidth?","answer":"A finite bandwidth limits how fast a signal can change. For a single-pole system, the rise time is approximately inversely proportional to the bandwidth, indicating that higher bandwidth circuits can produce faster transitions."}
{"id":9,"question":"Why do short-channel MOSFETs enable higher-speed operation?","answer":"Short-channel MOSFETs have lower gate capacitance and shorter carrier transit times. These properties reduce RC delays and allow the device to respond more quickly to changes in voltage."}
{"id":10,"question":"Why is voltage gain reduced at high frequencies?","answer":"At high frequencies, parasitic capacitances provide low-impedance paths that shunt signal current away from the load. This effect reduces the effective gain as frequency increases."}
